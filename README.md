# BeehiveManagementSystem
Simple live turn-based resource management game

Resource management game in which player has to manage his hive, can manipulate the number of each type of bee-workers:
1. Honey manufacturers - producing honey from nectar,
2. Nectar collectors - collect nectar from flowers around the hive,
3. Egg care bees - raise new bees 

Each turn player is presented with vault report containing information about storaged units of honey and nectar, alerts, egg count, unassigned workers, number of each type of workers and total number of workers.

Game contains alerts included in vault report which can help in managing your hive.

Project based of the one presented in "Head First C#, e4" book.
